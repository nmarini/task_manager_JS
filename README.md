# Task Manager
This app is designed to allow a user to create lists and add tasks onto those lists.  The tasks are then assigned to other users, who must accept the task and then complete the task.  Users are able to view their own lists and tasks, along with other users' lists and tasks.

## Usage

A user is first directed to create an account or login (via an already exisiting account, or through Facebook).
After a user is loged in, they are directed to the home page which reveals all of their tasks with a notification if they are accepted or unaccepted.

A user's profile page has all of their created lists and tasks assigned to the user.  The user's profile page also notifies the user with a warning if the user has any unaccepted tasks.

The app also includes a Lists page that includes a list of every users' list.  They also include a link that directs a user to the list's info page.  The info page includes all of the tasks associated with the list.

Each task's info page includes the task's note, a status of "Complete" or "Incomplete", and a list of users assigned to the task.

Both lists and tasks can be edited and deleted.
